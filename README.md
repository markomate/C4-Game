# C4 - Terminal Game

## Overview

C4 is a command-line interface game based off the popular two-player board game, Connect Four. It provides the player/s with a graphical representation of the board with various colours to chose from for pieces. The game can be enjoyed with a friend in 2P (two player) mode or alone versus a computer.

## Features:

1. Graphical representation of the board

Using characters and symbols, the players get a visual representation of the board and the state of their pieces. Empty slots are represented by O's and pieces are represented by these filled circles '‚óè'. Players can easily see which column is which by the numbers at the bottom.

2. Single or 2P game modes

Play with a friend or by yourself against machine! Both game types are available in the main menu to accommodate friends or solo players.

3. Name and colour

Players are able to choose from a variety of colours to play as. They also have the option to enter their name or keep the default 'Player 1' / 'Player 2' options.

4. Save state

During a game, the player has the option to save the game and exit. They are able to return the game at any time and their name and colour settings will also save!


5. ASCII titles

Players on start-up are welcommed to the game with large ASCII text! It follows in the options menu too and gives the menus a nice title.

6. Help & instructions

For anyone who doesn't understand how the game is played, there will be simple instructions in the help menu. There are also commands on how to use the application!
